# Privacy by Design

The idea is that data protection in data processing procedures is best adhered to when it is integrated into the technology. There is, however, still uncertainty about what “Privacy by Design” means, and how one can implement it. So let's explore this a little further.

The concept of Privacy by design is based on seven "foundational principles":

1. **Proactive not reactive; preventive, not remedial**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x54;he ComUnity platform will anticipate and take care of any privacy issues before they occur and not after._
2. **Privacy as the default setting**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x54;he user will not need to do anything to protect their data, it's protected by default._
3. **Privacy embedded into the design**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x50;rivacy is a core feature, it is not an add-in nor is it a detriment to functionality._
4. **Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x54;he best privacy measures should not lead to sub-standard functionality._
5. **End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x54;he privacy design should protect the user's privacy from beginning to end._
6. **Visibility and transparency – keep it open**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x41;ll privacy policies and their implementation should be open, transparent and verifiable._
7. **Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric**\
   &#xNAN;_&#x50;rivacy should be user-friendly so that all users can manage their own data._

We hope you found this short guide a useful introduction to designing for privacy, and highly recommend that you read more in the sources below.



The principles have been cited in over five hundred articles referring to the _Privacy by Design in Law, Policy and Practice_ white paper by [Ann Cavoukian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Cavoukian).

In practice, this consideration is already performed in an early development phase when setting technology decisions. Recognised certification can serve as an indicator to authorities that the persons responsible have complied with the statutory requirements of “Privacy by Design”.
