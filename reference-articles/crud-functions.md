# CRUD Functions

CRUD refers to the four major functions implemented in database applications, namely create, retrieve, update and delete.

The CRUD functions are the user interfaces to databases, as they permit users to create, view, modify and alter data. CRUD works on entities in databases and manipulates these entities. Any simple database table enforces CRUD constraints.
