# Bindings

By default when you create a custom web and then publish your project the Toolkit creates an initial `<tenantname>.webdev.comunity.me` binding for your application.&#x20;

A binding is a domain for your custom website. The ComUnity Developer Toolkit can be configured to point to several bindings for a single custom website.

View [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) to learn more about DNS registration and configuration.

ComUnity Platform also serves as a domain registrar, contact sales for more information on how to purchase and manage your domain.
