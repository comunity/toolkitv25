## Resources Settings

Resource Settings in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit offer valuable features to manage and optimise various types of content within your web pages. This includes the Mime Type and Content Type settings, which ensure proper handling and compatibility of files and resources.

Let's explore the details of the individual Resources Settings:

### Mime Type

Within the Resources section of the ComUnity Developer Toolkit, you can leverage the Mime Type feature to handle different types of files and their associated formats. This feature offers a drop-down menu that presents a variety of supported file extensions.

When uploading a file, you can select the relevant mime type from the drop-down menu. This ensures that the file is appropriately categorised and handled within the Toolkit, allowing for proper rendering and processing based on its specific format.

By utilising the Mime Type feature, you can ensure seamless compatibility and accurate handling of various file types, enabling a more efficient and effective management of resources within your web pages.

## **Content Type**

The Content Type setting in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit allows you to specify the type of resource for your content. It provides two supported options: text or file.

When selecting the **File** option, you gain access to additional settings that enable you to upload files directly from your local machine. This feature simplifies the process of incorporating various file types into your content.

Alternatively, if you choose the **Text** option, you are provided with a user-friendly text editor. This text editor allows you to conveniently input and format text content within the toolkit.

By utilising the Content Type setting, you can effectively manage and incorporate different types of resources, whether it be text-based content or files, into your web pages with ease.
