# Custom Website

The ComUnity Developer Toolkit is built for flexibility, enabling developers to adapt applications to meet specific project requirements. When the default screens do not sufficiently address your needs, the Custom Website feature allows you to create a dynamic web interface with full control over structure, layout, and content.

To create a Custom Website, follow these steps:

1. Open your project in the Toolkit and navigate to the **Custom Website** section.
2.  If you don't have an existing Custom Web section in your project, you will see a button **Configure a custom website for this project** else your Custom Website will be shown:\

3. Click Configure a custom website for this project

Please note that the configuration process might take some time. After the configuration is complete, your custom website will be displayed.

The essential building blocks of a custom website, presented in an intuitive tab view are: **Bindings**, **Templates**, **Pages**, and **Resources**. Each component plays a vital role in creating a personalised and functional web experience for your project.

1. [Bindings](bindings.md): Bindings enable you to configure domain mappings, establishing connections between A binding represents a specific domain associated with your custom website. With the ComUnity Developer Toolkit, you can configure multiple bindings to direct to a single custom website.
2. [Templates](pages/templates.md): Templates provide a structure for your custom website, allowing you to define reusable components and layouts. By utilising templates, you can maintain consistency across your front-end application, simplify the development process, and ensure a cohesive design and user experience.
3. [Pages](pages/): With the Pages component, you can create and organise your web pages, defining the layout and flow of your application. Each page can be customised to display the desired content and interact with the necessary server or data source to retrieve or submit data, providing flexibility and control over the presentation and functionality of your custom website.
4. [Page Elements](pages/page-elements.md): Page Elements are used to render dynamic page content, incorporating interactive and data-driven components within your custom website pages. These elements enable you to display and manipulate data, respond to user actions, and create a more engaging and interactive user experience.
5. [Resources](pages/resources.md): Resources consist of files used within the custom website, such as stylesheets, scripts, and other assets. By managing and leveraging these resources effectively, you can enhance the visual appeal and functionality of your front-end application, ensuring it meets the specific design and functionality requirements of your project.
