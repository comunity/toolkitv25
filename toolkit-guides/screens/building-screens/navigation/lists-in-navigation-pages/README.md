# Lists in Navigation pages

Lists are a versatile tool that can be used in **Navigation** pages to implement both [dynamic list rendering](dynamic-list-rendering-in-a-navigation-page.md) and [sub-screens](implementing-sub-screens-in-navigation-pages-using-list-items.md). Dynamic list rendering retrieves data from the Data service to generate a list of items, while sub-screens enable users to navigate between different screens in the application.

To use a List in a **Navigation** page, you first need to select it in the Screen Structure. This will display the List's supported screen controls and its properties. You can then configure the properties to enable dynamic list rendering or create sub-screens.\
