# Single Item - List Item

The **Single Item - List Item** is a core component of the ComUnity Toolkit, designed to render individual list items within your applicationâ€™s user interface. It provides flexibility in how data is displayed by allowing properties such as the title, icon, and page to be either dynamically retrieved from a data source or configured with static values.

The **Single Item** can be dynamically configured by defining its **Data Path**. This means that properties like the title, detail, and other attributes can be populated from the Data Service, ensuring real-time, context-specific information is displayed. Alternatively, these properties can be statically set for fixed content, depending on the requirements of your application.

A key feature of the **Single Item** is its ability to create direct, functional links between form screens by configuring the **Page** property, which specifies a relative path to the destination screen.

In this section, we will explore the key properties of a **Single Item**, focusing on its dynamic configuration using the **Data Path**, and provide a step-by-step guide on implementing it within a [Form ](../)page to establish functional links.

## Creating Functional Links to Additional Screens with Single Item - List Item

To create a functional link between a Form Page and an Additional Screen within your project, follow these steps:

**1. Add a List Component to Your Form page:**\
Begin by incorporating a List component within the Form page where you wish to create the navigation link.

**2. Integrate a Static Item screen control:**\
Within the List, introduce a Static Item screen control. This element will serve as the link between the existing Screen and the Form page.

**3. Access the Static Item Properties:**\
Click on the Static Item screen control  to select it. As you do so, the associated Properties will be revealed for configuration.

**4. Define the Page path:**\
In the displayed Properties, locate the **Page** property. Here, you can specify a relative path that corresponds to the **Additional Screen** you intend to navigate to. For instance, entering `./UserProfile` in the **Page** property would facilitate user movement from the current screen to the UserProfile screen.
