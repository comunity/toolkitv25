# Integrated Navigation and UI Builder for Screens in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit

The **Screen View** in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit is an integral part of the platform that allows developers to build screens for their applications. The Toolkit enforces a hierarchical structure for organising these screens, ensuring that the application's navigation is clear and logically structured. This hierarchical approach simplifies the management and organisation of screens, making it easier to maintain a coherent navigation flow as the application grows.

In the **Screen View**, you can expand each top-level screen to view its child screens, providing a comprehensive overview of your application's navigation structure. This representation helps you efficiently manage and organise the screens for your application.

To access the **Screen View** for your application's navigation and screens, open your project in the Toolkit and select the **Screens** tab in the sidebar.

Here is a breakdown of the components of the Screen View:

* **Screens**: The **Screens** component of the Screen View empowers users to build and visualise their application screens using a flexible hierarchical tree structure. Additionally, the integrated navigation functionality allows you to traverse the entire hierarchy of screens, ensuring a clear overview of the app's structure and layout. For an in-depth exploration of the **Screens** component, refer to the section on [Building your application navigation and manage pages](building-screens/).
* **Screen Structure**: The **Screen Structure** is a powerful component that allows you to easily create and manage the layout and organisation of your application screens. It provides a flexible hierarchical tree design that makes it easy to create multi-level screen arrangements. Whether you're creating a simple single-screen layout or a complex nested hierarchy, the S**creen Structure** can help you to ensure a smooth and intuitive user experience.
* **Screen Controls**: Discover a range of screen control widgets that are dynamically displayed to provide relevant functionality. For more details, refer to the [Screen Controls.](building-screens/screen-controls.md)
* **Additional Screens**: These refer to **Screens** that exist outside the primary navigational hierarchy. However, they can still be integrated into [Form](building-screens/form/) pages as inside [Lists](building-screens/form/lists-in-form-pages/) as [Single Item - List Item](building-screens/form/lists-in-form-pages/single-item-list-item-properties-and-practical-uses.md). To learn more about how to employ a Single Item to establish a functional link between a Form page and an existing screen, refer to the section on [Creating Functional Links to Additional Screens with Single Item - List Item](building-screens/form/lists-in-form-pages/single-item-list-item-properties-and-practical-uses.md#creating-functional-links-to-additional-screens-with-single-item-list-item).
* **Show system screens**: These **Screens** are an integral part of all projects by default. While these screens, such as Login, Registration, Reset Password, and OTP screens, should not be deleted, they can be customised to align with specific project requirements. You can easily manage the visibility of these system screens by toggling the **Show system screens** button.

With the Screen View’s powerful features and intuitive interface, you can efficiently create and manage your application’s screens, ensuring a smooth and engaging user experience.
