# Metrics



> The ComUnity Platform's metrics functionality is a crucial component for monitoring your project's performance, providing an in-depth view of various operational aspects through the Metrics dashboard. This dashboard presents critical data points and trends that are vital for maintaining and optimising your project's health and performance.

## **Key Benefits**

* **Comprehensive Performance Monitoring**: Gain insights into key performance indicators such as server response times, enabling you to detect and address performance issues proactively.
* **Informed Decision-Making**: Leverage detailed metrics to make informed decisions, ensuring your project's resources are optimised for peak performance.
* **Enhanced System Reliability**: Monitor system health and performance trends over time, aiding in the prevention of potential issues and ensuring system stability.

### **Detailed Insights Available on the Metrics Dashboard**

1. **Server Response Time**: This graph provides a real-time view of your server's response times, helping you identify trends and potential performance bottlenecks.
2. **Concurrent Responses**: Monitor the number of concurrent responses your server is handling to understand the load and performance under various conditions.
3. **Accumulative Users**: Track the growth of user engagement by viewing the cumulative number of users interacting with your project over time.
4. **Requests per Day (7 Days)**: Analyse the daily request volume over a week to identify usage patterns, peak times, and potential stress points on your infrastructure.

## **Accessing Your Project's Metrics Dashboard**

1. **Enable Observability**: First, ensure that the observability feature is active for your project. Consult the Observability Integration guide for instructions on enabling this feature.
2.  **Navigate to the Dashboard**: With observability enabled, access the "**Metrics**" tab in the Observability section. The Metrics dashboard will automatically display, offering a detailed overview of your project's key performance metrics.\
