# APIs

## Overview

The **Toolkitâ€™s API management feature** enables organisations to **connect to third-party services** by integrating with [**Azure API Management (APIM)**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-key-concepts). The Toolkit provides a structured way to **register and configure APIs**, eliminating the need for direct configuration in Azure while ensuring seamless integration with APIM.

Once APIs are registered in the Toolkit, they are **automatically synchronised with Azure API Management**, where developers can configure API operations such as request handling and transformations. The Toolkit serves as the central interface for managing API definitions, while API operations are set up in Azure API Gateway.

After integration, the Toolkit allows organisations to **expose APIs** using **Virtual Entities and** [**Custom Classes**](../custom-classes.md). These features provide a structured approach to defining how APIs are accessed and interacted with, ensuring clear separation of concerns and enabling controlled API consumption.

This API management feature is available for **single-tenant environments**, where organisations manage their own Azure subscription. Shared environment users do not have access to this functionality due to Azure subscription constraints.

For more details on Azure API Management, refer to the [Azure API Management documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/?source=recommendations).

## Key Features

1.  API Creation & Management: Developers can define APIs within the Toolkit, which are then registered in Azure API Management.\
    Supported API types:

    * &#x20;Custom HTTP API â€“ Manually configured endpoints.&#x20;
    * OData API â€“ Supports structured OData queries.&#x20;
    * OpenAPI â€“ Allows importing OpenAPI specifications.
    * GraphQL API â€“ Supports GraphQL-based queries.&#x20;

    APIs can be created using either: A **Service URL** (endpoint-based configuration). A **Definition Link** (importing OpenAPI/OData specifications).
2. Seamless Integration with Azure API Management: APIs registered via the Toolkit are automatically created in Azure API Gateway. The Toolkit UI provides a synchronisation feature to retrieve API operations from Azure. Built-in security policies, such as OAuth2 and JWT authentication, are applied through Azure APIM. API analytics and monitoring are available in Azure API Insights.
3. &#x20;Deployment & Environment Considerations\
   Only available for single-tenant environments, where the organisation manages its own Azure subscription. API deployment and mirroring into QA and Production environments are still under development. Shared environment users cannot access API Management features due to Azure subscription constraints.

## When to Use APIs

APIs management is particularly useful when:

* &#x20;Integrating External Services: If your application needs to communicate with external APIs securely and efficiently.&#x20;
* Centralising API Security & Access Control: By leveraging Azureâ€™s security policies, developers can manage authentication, authorisation, and traffic control without implementing custom security layers.&#x20;
* Enhancing Performance & Scalability: API Management enables caching, request throttling, and rate limiting, ensuring optimal performance under high load.&#x20;
* Monitoring & Logging API Traffic: Developers can track API usage, detect anomalies, and gain insights through Azure APIMâ€™s built-in monitoring tools.&#x20;
* Managing API Versions & Lifecycle: The Toolkit enables versioning and gradual rollouts of API changes, minimising disruptions for consumers. For further insights, explore Azure API Management Use Cases.\


## API Configuration Workflow&#x20;

1. Creating an API: Navigate to API Management in the Toolkit. Click "Add New API" and select the API type. Provide either a Service URL (for manual configuration) or a Definition Link (for OpenAPI/OData imports). Define the API name, description, and version. Click Save & Register API â€“ the API is now created in Azure API Management.&#x20;
2. &#x20;Configuring API Operations: API operations must be configured via the Azure API Management Portal: Open Azure API Management Portal. Locate the API created by the Toolkit. Define operations, authentication, and response configurations. Save and publish changes. Return to the Toolkit and click "Synchronise API Operations" to fetch updates from Azure.&#x20;
3. Testing & Deployment: Developers can use mock services in the Toolkit to validate API behaviour. API calls are logged in Azure API Insights for debugging and performance monitoring. Future updates will introduce automated deployment pipelines for QA and Production environments.

## Virtual Entities & Custom Classes for API Exposure

API Management in the Toolkit extends beyond simple configurationsâ€”it allows developers to expose APIs using [Virtual Entities](../data/creating-entities-in-the-data-model-step-by-step-guide.md#virtual-entities) and [Custom Classes](../custom-classes.md). These features provide a structured way to interact with API endpoints while maintaining separation of concerns. For detailed instructions, refer to the Virtual Entities & Custom Classes documentation.&#x20;

### Key Workflow

* **Creating a** **Virtual Entity** â€“ Developers can define Virtual Entities to represent external API resources. During setup, the Toolkit automatically generates the **Entity Class**, **Controller Class**, and **Controller Sample Code**, which are stored under **Custom Classes**.
* **Extending APIs with Custom Classes** â€“ The Controller Class can be modified to implement **custom business logic**, allowing APIs to be structured and managed efficiently. Custom Classes provide a flexible way to encapsulate API-related operations.
* **Deploying Extended API Features** â€“ Once custom logic is implemented, the API can be **deployed and made available to consumers**. API updates can be **versioned and synchronised** with **Azure API Management** for ongoing maintenance and improvements.

For more information, refer to the [Virtual Entities](../data/creating-entities-in-the-data-model-step-by-step-guide.md#virtual-entities) & [Custom Classes](../custom-classes.md) documentation.
