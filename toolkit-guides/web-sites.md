# Web sites

#### Overview

The Websites feature in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit allows developers to integrate static frontend sites directly into their project environment. It is designed to eventually replace the older ‘Custom Web’ interface, although both are currently supported.

Websites can be used to deploy lightweight frontends, custom tools, or portals like Community Central. Projects are created and managed entirely within the Toolkit and are accessible through a unique URL path.

#### Key Capabilities

* Host static websites (HTML/CSS/JS/images/fonts) from within a project.
* Built-in URL handler system for flexible routing.
* Support for custom frontend apps or admin portals.
* Access and preview your site via an autogenerated URL.
* Optional download of project source code for local editing.

#### What Are Web Files?

Websites are composed of static files typically found in web development:

| File Type     | Purpose                         |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| index.html    | Entry point of the site         |
| .js files     | Interactivity and logic         |
| .css files    | Styling and layout              |
| .png, .svg    | Images                          |
| .ttf, .woff2  | Fonts                           |
| manifest.json | Metadata, PWS config (optional) |
|               |                                 |

#### Accessing Your Website

```
https://<domain>/w/<app-name>/<url-suffix>
```

Where:

* /w/ is the static web handler
* \<app-name> is your project identifier
* \<url-suffix> is defined when you create the website

Example

* [https://toolkitv3.comunity.me/sw/pokeman/games/index.html](https://toolkitv3.comunity.me/sw/pokeman/games/index.html)

#### Handler Prefixes (Routing Conventions)

The platform uses dedicated handlers to route requests:

| Handle                    |                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| <h4><code>/p/</code></h4> | Polymer client              |
| <h4><code>/o/</code></h4> | OData API access            |
| <h4><code>/u/</code></h4> | Media upload/download       |
| <h4><code>/d/</code></h4> | Direct file download (SHA)  |
| <h4><code>/f/</code></h4> | Friendly filename downloads |
| <h4><code>/w/</code></h4> | Static website hosting      |
|                           |                             |

These handlers are not namespaces—they are internal URL routing tools (“handlers”) used by the platform to distinguish between services.

#### Creating a Website

1. Navigate to Websites under your project.
2. Provide a URL suffix (e.g., myportal).
3. Upload your static files.
4. Ensure index.html is placed in the root folder.
5. Click Open Website to launch it in a new tab.

\
Future update will support setting a custom default file (e.g., home.html) and changing it post-creation.

#### Testing & Default Behaviour

* The default document is index.html (must be at root level).
* If improperly structured, the site may need to be re-created.
* Auto-registration is active by default. This behaviour can be configured under:
  * Settings > Development Environment > Users & Roles > Credentials
  * Uncheck Disable Auto-Registration to force manual registration.
