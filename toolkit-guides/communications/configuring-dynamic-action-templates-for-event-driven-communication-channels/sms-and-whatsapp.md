# SMS & WhatsApp

SMS and WhatsApp are powerful communication channels that enable you to reach your audience instantly and directly. However, before using SMS and WhatsApp in your communication strategy, there are important considerations to keep in mind. These channels require pre-configuration according to the specifications and requirements of the respective service providers.

It's crucial to familiarise yourself with the specific guidelines and restrictions set by the SMS and WhatsApp service providers you plan to use. Each provider may have different requirements regarding message formatting, character limits, opt-in/opt-out mechanisms, and other compliance-related aspects. By adhering to these specifications, you can ensure the successful delivery of your messages and maintain a positive user experience.
