# HTTP

HTTP Communication Channel: The HTTP communication channel allows you to send messages using HTTP requests, typically to other services or APIs. This flexible channel enables integration with various external systems and platforms. By configuring the following fields, you can customise and control the HTTP request:

1. Header: The header field allows you to specify additional information about the request, such as authentication tokens, content type, or custom headers. You can include key-value pairs to provide necessary metadata for the HTTP request.

```
Authorization: Bearer your_token
Content-Type: application/json
```

2. Body: The body field contains the payload or data that you want to include in the HTTP request. It can be structured data in various formats such as JSON, XML, or plain text. You can dynamically populate this field with values from your event or use predefined variables.

```
{
  "message": "Hello, World!",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-26T10:00:00"
}
```

3. Target URL: The Target URL specifies the endpoint or destination where the HTTP request should be sent. It represents the URL of the external service or API that will receive your message. You can use placeholders or variables to dynamically construct the URL based on your event data.

```
https://api.example.com/notifications
```

4. Verb: The verb field indicates the HTTP method or action to be performed on the target URL. It defines the nature of the request, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc. You can choose the appropriate verb based on the desired interaction with the external service.

```
POST
```

By configuring these fields, you can tailor the HTTP request according to the requirements of the receiving service or API, enabling seamless integration and data exchange between systems.
