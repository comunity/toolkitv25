## **Data Model**

The following diagram shows the data model that will be created for the example application.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (338).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## **Data Service Project Development**&#x20;

The ComUnity platform leverages the Entity Framework Code First approach for the Data Service project, which forms the backbone of your application's data model. The Platform Toolkit Application streamlines the process of creating your data services project. It allows for the data model to be outlined through configuration data, simplifying the development process. Once your data model is defined, the Platform Toolkit Application will take charge, automatically generating, building, and publishing the data service project to IIS. This section will guide you through these steps, ensuring a smooth transition from concept to a functioning component of your application.

### Data Model Configuration

To configure your Data Model, follow these steps:

1. &#x20;Login into the ComUnity Developer Toolkit.
2.  Create a project using the Blank Project template with a unique title, an illustration is shown in the following diagram:\


    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-12-18 at 06.01.26.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create a new Blank Project in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit</p></figcaption></figure>
3.  After successfully creating your project the Toolkit will successfully redirect you to your project structure. The diagrams below show a the structure of the created Data Model of your project:\


    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (336).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Data Model of a newly created BlogApp shown as a List</p></figcaption></figure>

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (337).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The Data Model of a newly created BlogApp shown as a Diagram</p></figcaption></figure>
4. In this step we will create the custom entities shown in the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the application above and populate them with field properties, to get started:
   1. Navigate to the "**Data**" section within the Toolkit. Once there, locate and click on the "**List view**" tab. This area allows you to view and manage the entities within your data model.
   2. Locate and click the **"Add new entity"** icon to initiate the creation of a new entity.
   3. In the **"Entity Name"** field, enter `Post` as the name of your new entity.
   4.  Confirm the creation by clicking the **"Add Entity"** button. This action will successfully create the "**Post**" entity within your Data Model.\


       <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (139).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Adding the Post entity to the Data Model</p></figcaption></figure>

       <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (140).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Default attributes or properties of a newly created Post entity</p></figcaption></figure>
   5.  To add custom properties to the "Post" entity, right-click on any existing property, follow these steps:

       1. Expand the "**Post**" entity to reveal its properties by clicking the **"+"** sign next to the entity's name.
       2.  To add a new property, click on any existing property within the "Post" entity. A modal will appear, offering you the options to **"Add a property above"** or **"Add a property below"** the selected property. Select a single option from these choices. Refer to the screenshot provided for guidance:\


           <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (142).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Add properties to an entity</p></figcaption></figure>


       3.  In the **"Add new property"** modal that pops up, enter the desired property name. Finalise this action by clicking the **"Save"** button, as illustrated in the diagram below. Note that the Table in step 5 contains an exhaustive list of all the entities required for the application and their relevant properties.\


           <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (418).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
       4.  After saving, select the newly added property to customise it further in the Properties Editor. For example, we have adjusted the "**Summary**" property by setting its data type to 'String' (which is the default) and restricting the "**Max Length**" to 256 characters, as shown in the subsequent screenshot.\


           <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (145).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
       5. Click **"Save"** to apply these specifications and repeat the steps specified above using the data specified in the table below:\


       <table><thead><tr><th width="156">Entity</th><th width="108">Properties</th><th width="123">Data Types</th><th width="180">Rules</th><th width="117">Required</th><th>Default Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Post</td><td>Title</td><td>string</td><td>Max Length = 64</td><td>Checked</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Summary</td><td>string</td><td>Max Length = 256</td><td>Checked</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Body</td><td>string</td><td>            -</td><td>Unchecked</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Publish</td><td>bool</td><td>             -</td><td>Checked</td><td>false</td></tr><tr><td>Tag </td><td>Name</td><td>string</td><td>Max Length = 32</td><td>Checked</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Icon</td><td>string</td><td>Max Length = 50</td><td>Unchecked</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Comment</td><td>Detail</td><td>string</td><td>            -</td><td>Checked</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>
5. In this step, we'll establish **Table Security** rules for the entities we've previously created. These rules are crucial as they determine who has the permissions to view, edit, and delete data within the table linked to each entity. Follow the steps below to configure Table Security rules for the "Post" entity:
   1. Navigate to the List view of the entities in your Data Model
   2. Locate and select the "**Post**" entity from the list. This action will activate the Properties Editor specifically for the "Post" entity, allowing you to modify its settings.
   3. With the "**Post**" entity selected, look for and click on the "**Edit Security**" option. This action will open the "Table Security for Post" modal.
   4.  Within the modal, you will see various permissions that can be enabled or disabled for different roles. Refer to the image below for the desired output settings for the "**Post**" Entity. Adjust the permissions by checking (to grant) or unchecking (to revoke) the relevant boxes for each role:\


       <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (379).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
   5. After configuring the security settings for the "Post" entity, repeat the same steps for each entity you have added to the Data Model. Select the entity, click on "Edit Security," and adjust the permissions as necessary, ensuring comprehensive security coverage across all entities.
6. In this step we will create associations of the entities we created in the step above, lets link the User Profile to the Post entity, to get started:
   1. Navigate to the List view of the entities in your Data Model
   2. Select the UserProfile entity&#x20;
   3.  Click the icon to add an association, in the Add new entity link you must specify the from and to  entities of your association for which in the case the from entity is the UserProfile and the to entity is Post and then click the Save button\
       \


       <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (334).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
   4. &#x20;To view the association between UserProfile and  Post entities created in the previous step, simply expand the collapsible UserProfile in the list. You'll see the Post association listed beneath it, indicating their connection.&#x20;
   5.  Select the association to configure its properties in the Properties Editor, in this case you set the From Relationship to 1(One) and the To Relationship to \*(Many) and click the Save button to persist your settings.\


       <div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png" alt="" width="230"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>
   6.  Click Save and repeat the steps specified above using the relationships specified in the table below and ensure that the field "**Add Foreign Key Property"** is checked for all associations you create.\


       <table><thead><tr><th width="155">From Entity</th><th width="124">To Entity</th><th width="172">Relationship Type</th><th width="167">From Entity Navigation Name</th><th width="178">From Relationship</th><th width="165">To Entity Navigation Name</th><th width="150">To Relationship</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>UserProfile</td><td>Post</td><td>One is to Many</td><td>Posts</td><td>Many</td><td>User</td><td>0..1</td></tr><tr><td>UserProfile</td><td>Comment</td><td>One is to Many</td><td>Comments</td><td>Many</td><td>User</td><td>0..1</td></tr><tr><td>Post </td><td>Tag</td><td>Many to  Many</td><td>Tags</td><td>Many</td><td>Posts</td><td>Many</td></tr><tr><td>Post</td><td>Comment</td><td>One is to Many</td><td>Comments</td><td>Many</td><td>Post</td><td>0..1</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

## Data Service Publishing

The ComUnity Developer Toolkit streamlines the development process by automatically provisioning necessary resources on Microsoft Azure and constructing your Data Service project based on the defined data model. This integration includes executing data migrations for existing databases and deploying your project to Internet Information Services (IIS) following a successful build. However, it's crucial to note that any alterations to the data model, custom classes, or virtual entities necessitate a project rebuild to avoid data loss and maintain application consistency, to learn more view [Build and Launch your project](../getting-started/manage-your-project/build-and-launch-your-project.md).

When viewing your application in the browser you will be redirected to the Accept Terms, after clicking the "ACCEPT TERMS" button users are redirected to the authentication screens:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (339).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Accept Term screen</p></figcaption></figure>

## **Metadata Configuration**&#x20;

In this section of the tutorial, we'll focus on how metadata is utilised to design the application's navigation and its pages. You'll learn how to create various screens for key functionalities, including:

* Viewing all published articles.
* Browsing articles categorised by tags.
* Creating, editing, and tagging posts.
* Editing user profiles.
* Adding comments to articles.
* Admin functions like adding or removing tags, editing all articles, and managing comments (including deletion).

We'll also delve into setting up navigation items. These links are essential for connecting the pages and defining the application's flow. They play a crucial role in forming simple pages containing lists and in structuring the application menus.

Let's create the main screens that exist in the app, the app requires the following screens:

* My Articles - a screen allows users to view all articles they created
* Add Article - a screen that allows users to add blog articles
* Edit Article - a screen that allows users to edit the blog articles they created
* All Articles - a screen that allows users to view all published blog articles
* View Article - a screen that allows users to view a single blog article and  navigate to an Add Comment
* Add Comment -  a screen that allows users to add comments to a blog article

The diagram below shows the hierarchical structure of the aforementioned screens:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (380).png" alt="" width="308"><figcaption><p>Screen hierarchy in the Blog application </p></figcaption></figure>

### My Articles screen

**Data Entry Screens** are a powerful feature of the Toolkit that automate the creation of user interfaces for interacting with database entities. By simply selecting an entity, the Toolkit generates a suite of screens allowing users to view all items associated with that entity, inspect details of individual items, and update information as needed. This functionality is particularly useful for applications requiring dynamic content management, such as managing articles or blog posts. The **"My Articles"** screen will comprise a group of screens enabling users to create blog posts, view their posts, and edit them created from Data Entry Screens. Additionally, these screens will be further customised to incorporate the functionality of adding **Tags**, enhancing the organisation and searchability of content.\
\
To create the **My Articles** screen and its child screens, follow these steps:

1. In the Toolkit, find and click on the **"Screens"** menu item located in the sidebar. All screens which exist in your application will be displayed in the **Screen View**.
2.  Select the any of the top-level screens , such as **"Administration"** and click the three-dot-button adjacent to the selected screen, then click **"Add data screens above"** as shown below:\


    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (115).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Adding Data Entry Screens above Administration screen</p></figcaption></figure>


3.  In the **"Add data entry screens"** modal, use the **Entity** dropdown to choose the **"Post"** entity. This selection informs the Toolkit of the specific entity it should use to generate your screens.\


    <div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (136).png" alt="" width="375"><figcaption><p>Select an entity for your Data Entry Screens<br></p></figcaption></figure> <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (116).png" alt="" width="275"><figcaption><p>Desired layout after adding Data Entry Screens</p></figcaption></figure></div>


4. With the data screens generated, we will proceed on to customising and configuring each screen to align with the **"My Articles"** concept. This involves setting titles, adjusting properties, and ensuring that the layout and functionality meet your requirements for content management:

#### My Articles > Post  screen

1.  Select the **Post** screen in the **Screen View**, then update the **Title** of the screen in the Properties Editor from "**Post"** to "**My Articles"** as shown in the screenshot below:\


    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (134).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
2. In the Properties Editor set the value of the field Icon to `cog` .
3. Click the **Save** button to persist your changes.
4.  Click and select the **List** screen control in the Screen Structure to activate its Properties Editor, and set the properties outline in the table below:\


    <table><thead><tr><th width="125">Property</th><th width="289">Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Data Path</td><td>/UserProfile(guid'{{=userguid}}')/Posts</td><td>This property defines the specific endpoint or route for accessing posts associated with a user's profile in the application. The dynamic portion, <code>guid'{{=userguid}}'</code>, is a placeholder that gets replaced with the actual globally unique identifier (GUID) of the user at runtime. This ensures that the data fetched or submitted via this path is precisely linked to the correct user profile, facilitating targeted retrieval or update of posts under a specific user's account. It's essential for operations like displaying a user's articles or submitting new ones under their profile.</td></tr><tr><td>Item Title</td><td>{{= Title}}</td><td><p>The <code>Item Title</code> property specifies the template for dynamically displaying the title of each item, such as a post or article, retrieved from the data source. By using the placeholder <code>{{= Title}}</code>, the system automatically inserts the title of each respective post into the layout or list where this template is applied. This dynamic binding ensures that the displayed title matches exactly what is stored for each post in the database, providing a direct and accurate reflection of the content to the user.</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td>Item Detail</td><td>{{ = Summary}}</td><td>This property sets the template for presenting a brief description or summary of each item, like an article or blog post. The placeholder <code>{{= Summary}}</code> is used to dynamically insert the summary content of each post into the display interface. This approach allows for a concise overview of each post's content to be presented alongside its title, offering users a snapshot of what the post is about before deciding to read further. It enhances the usability of lists or feeds by giving context to each listed item, making it easier for users to navigate through content.</td></tr></tbody></table>


5. Click the **Save** button to persist your changes.

#### My Articles > Add Post Record  screen

1. **Add Post Record** screen
   1.  Click on the "Add Post Record" screen  in the Screen View to activate its supported  Properties Editor, then set the properties outlines in the table below:\


       <table><thead><tr><th width="100">Property</th><th width="276">Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Title</td><td>Add Article</td><td>This property defines the heading or title of the screen in the application.</td></tr><tr><td>Target URL</td><td>/UserProfile(guid'{{=userguid}}')/Posts</td><td><p>The <code>Target URL</code> property specifies the endpoint or API route the application will call to perform a specific operation, in this context, to submit or associate new posts with a user's profile. The dynamic part of the URL, <code>guid'{{=userguid}}'</code>, is replaced at runtime with the actual GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) of the user, ensuring that the new posts are correctly linked to the user's profile. This URL pattern facilitates direct access to a subset of data related to the user, specifically their posts, enabling a seamless data submission process.</p><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table>


   2.  Click and select the **Auto Inputs** screen control in the screen screen structure to activate its Properties Editor, and set the properties outline in the table below:\


       <table><thead><tr><th width="275">Property</th><th width="211">Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Exclude</td><td>Tags,User,Comments</td><td>Comma delimited list of Post entity navigations to exclude from Auto Input control</td></tr></tbody></table>


   3. Click the **Save** button to persist your changes.

#### My Articles > PostEditPage  screen

1. Select the "PostEditPage" screen in the Screen View, then update the Title of the screen in the Properties Editor from **Edit** **Record** to **Edit Article** as we did in the previous step.
2.  Edit the Target URL field from /Post to:\


    ```
    /UserProfile(guid'{{=userguid}}')/Posts({{= postId }})
    ```

    \
    This request is intended to perform a partial update on a specific post within the collection of posts associated with a particular user profile, identified by a GUID.
3. Click **Save** to persist your changes.
4.  Click and select the **Auto Inputs** screen control in the screen screen structure to activate its Properties Editor, and set the properties outline in the table below:\


    <table><thead><tr><th width="275">Property</th><th width="198">Value</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Exclude</td><td>Tags,User,Comments</td><td>Comma delimited list of Post entity navigations to exclude from Auto Input control</td></tr></tbody></table>


5. Click **Save** to persist your changes.
6.  Click the "**Edit Article"** screen to activate its supported Properties Editor and carefully observe the **"Name"** property within the Properties Editor. In the example provided below, the name of the screen is identified as **"1PostEditPage"**.\


    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (381).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
7.  Proceed to your **"My Articles"** section and select the **"List"** option to continue. Within the Properties Editor for the **"List"** screen, locate the section for setting the **Target URL**. Update the Target URL field with the following link:



    ```
    LINK:1PostEditPage?postId={{= PostId }}
    ```

    \
    The Target URL you've set, `1PostEditPage?postId={{= PostId }}`, plays a crucial role in linking users from one part of your application to a specific editing page for articles, utilising a dynamic parameter to provide a customised experience.

       | Property    | Value                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
       | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
       | Icon        | cogs                                                                 | This property specifies an icon to be used in conjunction with the screen or page title, enhancing the visual appeal and providing a visual cue about the action or content associated with the title.                                                         |
       | Data Path   | /Post                                                                | Defines the endpoint URL (`/Post`) for retrieving data from the backend. This path is used to construct the full oData query URL for fetching data, specifically targeting the "Post" resource in the database.                                                |
       | Query       | Publish eq true and Deleted eq null                                  | This property sets a filter condition for the oData query, instructing the system to retrieve only those records where the `Publish` attribute is `true`. This ensures that only published items are fetched from the database.                                |
       | Item Title  | \{{= Title \}}                                                       | Specifies the template for displaying each list item's title, dynamically inserting the `Title` property of the data item. This allows for a flexible display of titles based on the data retrieved.                                                           |
       | Item Detail | <p>{{= Summary }}<br>Author: {{= User/Name }} {{= User/Surname}}</p> | Sets the template for displaying detailed information about each list item. It combines static text with dynamic data fields, showing the item's `Summary` followed by the author's full name, which is constructed from related user data (Name and Surname). |
       | Target URL  | LINK:AllArticlesList\_PageItem?postId=\{{= PostId \}}                | Defines a template for constructing URLs to link to detailed article views. This property dynamically inserts the `PostId` of the current item into the query parameter of the URL, facilitating navigation to a detailed view page for each article.          |
       | Item Aside  | \{{= Created \}}                                                     | This property defines what is displayed in the aside section of each list item, in this case, the creation date of the article. The template dynamically inserts the `Created` date, formatting it day-month format without the year.                          |


6. To view your changes, **either launch your app or, if it's already open, reload the page twice.**
