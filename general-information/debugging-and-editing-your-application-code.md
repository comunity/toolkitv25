# Debugging and editing your application code

The recommended workflow for effective editing and debugging of complex code in your ComUnity Projects is outlined below:

### Pre-requisites

High level proficiency in C# and .NET application development.

### Set up your local development environment

The ComUnity Development Toolkit has a default text editor which has limitations when it comes to editing complex codebases. The tools outlined below will offer a better development experience in scenarios where you have to manipulate complex code, download and install them for your operating system.

1. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)&#x20;
2. [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)&#x20;
3. [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16) or [Azure Data Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/data-explorer/#overview) as your database client.

### Download the Data Service Project from the ComUnity Toolkit

To download your project from the ComUnity Developer Toolkit to your local development environment, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Configuration** > **Application**&#x20;
2. Navigate to the **Download Data Service Project** section in the **Content Area.**
3. Click **Create Archive**, to create a .zip file of your data service projec&#x74;**.**
4. Click the generated archive to download it.

### Local Development

After you finish editing or resolving your bugs in your local environment ensure that the application builds successfully and then copy all the updated files and paste them where it is relevant and then rebuild your project.
