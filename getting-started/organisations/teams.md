## Assign Teams to a Project

**Responsibility and Prerequisites**

The task of assigning teams to a project is entrusted to the Project Owner. Before proceeding, ensure that the necessary teams have already been established within your organisation. This step requires collaboration with the Organisational Administrator, who is responsible for creating teams and assigning members to those teams.

## Assigning Teams to a Project

In the Toolkit, the flexibility of project management is enhanced by allowing Project Owners to assign teams not only after a project has been established but also directly during the project creation phase. This capability streamlines the setup process, ensuring that the right resources and teams are aligned from the outset.

**Assigning Teams During Project Creation**

1.  **Initiate Project Creation**: When creating a new project within the Toolkit, fill out the project details as prompted.

2. **Team Assignment Option**: Look for the **"Assign one or more teams to the project"** section within the project creation interface. This step occurs before finalising the project setup.
3. **Select Teams**: Choose from the list of available teams within your organisation. If the required team is not listed, remember that the Organisational Administrator can create and configure new teams.
4. **Finalise Project Creation**: After selecting the desired teams, proceed to complete the remaining project details and finalise the creation process.

**Assigning Teams to an Existing Project - Project Teams**

For Project Owners looking to assign teams to an already existing project:

1. **Login to the ComUnity Developer Toolkit**
2. **Select your Project**: From the dashboard, select the project you wish to manage.
3. Open Project Settings: After opening your project in the Toolkit, click the cog icon labelled Project Settings (displayed with a tooltip reading “Project settings”). For additional details on accessing Project Settings, refer to the [General ](../manage-your-project/general.md)section.
4.  **Navigate to Project teams**: In the Project Settings window, select "Project teams."\

6. **Multiple Team Assignments**: Remember, it's possible to assign multiple teams to a single project, enhancing collaboration and resource allocation.
