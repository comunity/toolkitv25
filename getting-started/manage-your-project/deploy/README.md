## **Key Features**

**Streamlined Deployment Workflow:**

* **Dedicated Environments:** Leverage three distinct environments – Development, QA/Testing, and Production – each designed for a specific stage of your project's lifecycle.
* **Seamless Transitions:** Promote code smoothly between environments, ensuring an efficient development process.
* **Enhanced Testing:** Conduct thorough testing in the QA/Testing stage, closely mimicking the production environment to identify and address potential issues before launch.

**Unparalleled Security and Control:**

* **Granular Permissions:** Define and assign specific roles and permissions to team members, granting access only to the environments and resources they need.
* **Safeguarded Code:** Restrict unauthorised access to development and testing environments, protecting your codebase from unintended modifications.
* **Clear Accountability:** Track changes and identify responsible parties easily with role-based access controls.
