# Create a project

To create a project using the ComUnity Developer Toolkit, the first step is to log in to the platform. If you're unsure about the login process, you can refer to the [Login](../comunity-developer-toolkit/login.md) section for more information.

Once you have successfully logged in, you will be directed to the Home screen. If you are already actively engaged in a project, click on the Home navigation item located within the menu bar.

To create a new project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Start a new project** section at the bottom of your home page. Here, you'll find a variety of templates to choose from to help you create your project.
2. If you're not sure which template to use, you can check out the [Samples](samples.md) section to learn more. Alternatively, you can use a blank template, by selecting the **Blank Project**.
3.  Once you've found a suitable template, click on the **Use This** button on the template's card. This will open a new dialog box where you can enter your project details.

4. Enter a unique name for your project in the **Project name** box.
5. Click on the **Create** button to create your new project
6. Once your project is successfully created, click on **Settings** to access your project's settings.

Congratulations on successfully creating your new project! The next step is to [Build and launch your project](build-and-launch-your-project.md) for the first time so as to publish it on Internet Information Services(ISS). Once you've done that, you can start building your project using the [Toolkit Guides](https://github.com/comunity/toolkitv5tooltips/blob/main/getting-started/manage-your-project/broken-reference/README.md).
