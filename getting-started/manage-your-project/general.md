# General

> The General tab in Project Settings displays key project properties, including the Application Name, Application Namespace, Organisation Name, Creation Date, Last Modified Date, and Application Title.

## Key Features

* **Application Name**: Displays the current name of your application. This name is normally used when referring to the code dynamically in the source code for customisations and is immutable.
* **Application Namespace**: Shows the namespace associated with your application.
* **Organisation Name**: Indicates the name of the organisation linked to the project.
* **Created**: Shows the date and time when the project was created.
* **Last Modified**: Displays the date and time of the last modification made to the project.
*   **Application Title**: Allows you to modify the title of your app. When you create a project, the name you set during the project creation process becomes the default title of your app. The General section offers an opportunity to create a new title distinct from the project name. This flexibility allows you to tailor the app title to better reflect its purpose or branding without altering the project's original name.\
