# Manage your project

A tenant is an instance of the ComUnity Platform, that is provisioned to an organisation. The type of tenancy supported in your organisation depends on your licence for further details view [ComUnity Developer Toolkit/Login ](../comunity-developer-toolkit/login.md)section. Each tenant is identified using a unique system generated name which is not configurable. Each ComUnity Platform tenant is distinct, unique, and separate from all other ComUnity Platform tenants.  A tenant can have many projects but each project belongs to a single tenant.

A _project_ in the ComUnity Developer Toolkit contains everything that defines your namespace for an application.
