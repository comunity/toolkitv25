# Store URLs

> The Store URLs section under Project Settings allows developers to configure app store URLs (Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Microsoft Store) associated with the native mobile and desktop apps generated from their projects. The Toolkit enables building web, native mobile apps, and Windows desktop apps from the same code base. This section enhances user experience by ensuring that when users visit the web app on their mobile devices, they are redirected to the relevant app store for downloading the native app, achieved through deep linking. Similarly, if users visit on a desktop and a Windows app is available, they can be redirected to the Microsoft Store.  This functionality is only active if the other variants of the app, aside from web, are supported. To request an app, please contact the ComUnity team.&#x20;
